INT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE, SOUTH BOSTON -- EVENING

               The bar is dirty, more than a little run down. If there is
               ever a cook on duty, he's not here now. As we pan across
               several empty tables, we can almost smell the odor of last
               nights beer and crushed pretzels on the floor.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Oh my God, I got the most fucked up
                         thing I been meanin' to tell you.

               As the camera rises, we find FOUR YOUNG MEN seated around a
               table near the back of the bar.

                                     ALL
                         Oh Jesus. Here we go.

               The guy holding court is CHUCKIE SULLIVAN, 20, and the largest
               of the bunch. He is loud, boisterous, a born entertainer.
               Next to him is WILL HUNTING, 20, handsome and confident, a
               softspoken leader. On Will's right sits BILLY MCBRIDE, 22,
               heavy, quiet, someone you definitely wouldn't want to tangle
               with.

               Finally there is MORGAN O'MALLY, 19, smaller than the other
               guys. Wiry and anxious, Morgan listens to Chuckie's horror
               stories with eager disgust.

               All four boys speak with thick Boston accents. This is a
               rough, working class Irish neighborhood and these boys are
               its product.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You guys know my cousin Mikey
                         Sullivan?

                                     ALL
                         Yeah.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Well you know how he loves animals
                         right?  Anyway, last week he's drivin'
                         home...
                              (laughs)

                                     ALL
                         What? Come on!

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (trying not to laugh)
                         I'm sorry, 'cause you know Mikey,
                         the fuckin guy loves animals, and
                         this is the last person you'd want
                         this to happen to.

                                     WILL
                         Chuckie, what the fuck happened?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Okay. He's driving along and this
                         fuckin' cat jumps in front of his
                         car, and so he hits this cat--

               Chuckie is really laughing now.
